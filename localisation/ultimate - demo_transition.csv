democratic_transition_d_title;Begin the democratic transition;x;;
democratic_transition_d_desc;Our monarch serves no other purpose than being a symbol and having a small amount of control over the laws of our country. Yet we feel like if we removed him from his position into a solely symbolic one we could turn our country into a real democracy. Of course for this we would need the support of the people and the administration to be able to change from a constitutional monarchy into a complete democracy.;x;;
demo_trans_ev01;Democratic transition begun;x;;
demo_trans_ev01_desc;As we chose to become a democracy throwing away the monarchic values of our past we still needed to ask the king to accept our choice. Or if so we chose we could try going without asking him, but it could lead to foreign intervention.;x;;
demo_trans_ev01_opt1;Ask the king;x;;
demo_trans_ev01_opt2;Don't ask him;x;;
demo_trans_ev02a;King says yes!;x;;
demo_trans_ev02a_desc;We asked the king for his opinion on turning the country into a complete democracy and he agreed! He realised that the time of glorious monarchs and royal families are over. This way we have the royal support to carry out our goal.;x;;
demo_trans_ev02a_opt;Great!;x;;
demo_trans_ev02b;King says no!;x;;
demo_trans_ev02b_desc;The monarch of our nation said no to our goals calling them too ambitious. He does not believe in the new ways of democracy and he thinks that the time of once great royal families still did not pass.;x;;
demo_trans_ev02b_opt;Blast!;x;;
demo_trans_ev03a;Unrest grows;x;;
demo_trans_ev03a_desc;After our monarch agreed upon reforming our government some supporters of us became more and more radical, wanting more than simple democracy, many other radical groups joining them wanting their own reforms included in the new democratic consitution. Shall we still continue and try to reform the government like this or give up this goal for now?;x;;
demo_trans_ev03a_opt1;We shall proceed.;x;;
demo_trans_ev03a_opt2;Maybe next time...;x;;
demo_trans_ev03b;We shall proceed;x;;
demo_trans_ev03b_desc;After our monarch said yes to the reform of the government we could start carrying out the administrational reforms regarding the change of constitution. It is a bright day for our nation.;x;;
demo_trans_ev03b_opt;Let's do it.;x;;
demo_trans_ev03c;Next step?;x;;
demo_trans_ev03c_desc;With the king saying no to the reform or without us asking him there is little we can do without royal support. Of course we could try to continue the consitutional reform, but then our king will surely ask for outside intervention, dragging our country into a war. Or we could choose to stop the reform and try again later.;x;;
demo_trans_ev03c_opt1;Maybe next time...;x;;
demo_trans_ev03c_opt2;We will fight!;x;;
demo_trans_event_04a;Success!;x;;
demo_trans_event_04a_desc;We have succefully reformed the consitution turning our country into a democracy with all of its up and downsides. We might or might not regret this later, but for now we shall celebrate.;x;;
demo_trans_ev04a_opt;Hurray!;x;;
demo_trans_event_04b;Rioting!;x;;
demo_trans_event_04b_desc;All of our major cities and even the countryside experiences severe riots and major vandalism as the radical groups are gaining more and more supporters. There is almost nothing we can do as some groups start surrounding the city hall of our capital. What should we do?;x;;
demo_trans_ev04b_opt1;Shoot them!;x;;
demo_trans_ev04b_opt2;Bribe them!;x;;
demo_trans_event_05;Open rebellion?;x;;
demo_trans_event_05_desc;Shooting into the crowd leaded not to the crowd starting to calm down, but to an even higher level of radicalization. More and more people of our population joins these groups for one or another reason. We fear what will the future bring for us. We must drop the idea of reforming the constituion for now, we will be happy to see the morning sun...;x;;
demo_trans_event_05_opt;Blast...;x;;
demo_trans_event_06a;Unsuccesful briberies;x;;
demo_trans_event_06a_desc;Trying to bribe the leaders of the radical groups only led to an uproar between them and the population. We face harsh times as most of these groups used our bribes to buy firearms from foreign counties. We must drop the idea of reforming the constituion for now, that is for sure.;x;;
demo_trans_event_06a_opt;Blast...;x;;
demo_trans_event_06b;Briberies succesful;x;;
demo_trans_event_06b_desc;Apparently we chose correctly when we bribed the leaders of the radical movements. They might talk about fulfilling the goals of the people, but they are not any better than the corrupt bureaucrats. Now we can focus on reforming the constitution.;x;;
demo_trans_event_06b_opt;Finally.;x;;
demo_trans_event_07;Our population mobilizes;x;;
demo_trans_event_07_desc;With the recent developements of a foreign power declaring war on us due to the call of our now imprisoned king each and every one of our citizens took up the arms to fight for their freedom, for their nation. We shall not bow to any king or any power anymore!;x;;
demo_trans_event_07_opt;Onward!;x;;
demo_trans_event_08;Victory!;x;;
demo_trans_event_08_desc;We have won! Our monarch chose the wrong power to bring in against us as our population, which rose up to defend its well-earned freedom has defeated every one of the armies sent against us. We shall carry out our reform and become a democracy.;x;;
demo_trans_event_08_opt;Finally!;x;;
demo_trans_event_09;Defeat!;x;;
demo_trans_event_09_desc;Our people fought bravely against the endless waves the enemy our own king sent against us but it was not enough. We lost and our king was placed back onto his throne and took all rights from the people.;x;;
