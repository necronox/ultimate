Konstantinos Paleologos is the Emperor now. He is great great great grand son of the last Emperor!

reclaim_the_old_glory_desc;The Byzantine Empire has grown in importance and territories the last years. Alas the glorious Emperor Konstantinos Paleologos that took back the greek lands from the Ottomans has long been dead. But his dream isn't! The byzantine-greek nation that he created feels now strong enough to reclaim its rightfull capital Kwnstantinoupolis. And that's not all ! Manouil Komnhnos, a descendant of that old Emperor with the same name wants the Byzantine Empire to reclaim all the provinces that his great great great grand father lost to the Seljuk Turks. That is Mikra Asia! To acomplish that he decides to move the capital to Salonika, previously the second in importance city of the Ottoman Empire and much closer to Kwnstantinoupolis than Mystras. He thinks that this is a symbolic as well as a practical decision. This way he will be able to control the war operations to recapture Kwnstantinoupolis. Furthermore he will be to influence the population of Thrace if they are to assist him in his plan to ceize Kwnstantinopolis from the Otomans. Fortunately the people Mikra Asia are fed up with Ottoman oppression and stories about the good old days of the Byzantine Emperors are told. As of today they accept Manouil as their saviour and the Byzantine banner as their flag !;x;;

vasileios_voulgaroktonos_desc;The glorious Emperor Manouil Komnhnos that took back Kwnstantinoupolis from the Ottomans is dead. Unfortunately he didn’t see his dream materialised. Vasileios from the house of Makedwns is now Emperor. And he has decided to follow the steps of his predecesor. He decides to move the capital to Kwnstantinoupolis and bring the city to its former glory. A palace will be built upon the place where the old sacred palace of the ancient Byzantine Emperors lied. Aquedacts, Ipodromos, and other great projects will be undertaken. His goal is to show the splendor of the Byzantine empire and make everybody have no dought that the Byzantine ownership of Kwnstantinoupolis is not temporary. But he also has something else in his mind. For centuries the Slav people of the Balkans are oppresed by the Ottomans. Vasileios, as his anchestor with the same name in 11th century, feels that he has to help the Orthodox Slavs to realize their Orthodox identity. Vasileios sent missionaries, organized  cultural events and had an intense diplomatic activity, including briberies and mariages. The result is that the Slavs have reconfirmed their Orthodox identity and realized that they are more Byzantines than subjects to the Sultan. Today is a glorious day for the Byzantine Empire!  The Slavs decided to accept Vasileio as their saviour and the byzantine banner as their flag !! ;x;;

eastern_empire_desc;Many years have passed since Emperor Vasileios from the house of Makedwns annexed the Balkans. The Byzantine Empire is one of the greatest Empires in the world, in terms of territories, population, production and money. The Ottomans are falling apart with continues national, social or political rebelions. A debate has risen among the scholars of the Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire, containing among others Egypt, the coast of the middle east and Anatolia as far as Armenia,  is lost for almost 1000 years. But there is a lot of land, raw material and  workforce (or else conscriptable population), there for a thriving Emprire like ours to let go. The past several years all the Emperors tried to make a bond with all these different people. The main obstacle was the cultural differences and religion. Konstantinos, our current Emperor, thought of something clever. The bond doesn't have to be religious or cultural. It will just be military! As long as our mighty army is able to protect their properties, land and their way of life, they should accept our dominion. This way he persuaded the people that live in the territories of the former Eastern Roman Empire, to bow to him and accept the Byzantine banner as their flag !!;x;;

As of today they accept Ioustinianos as their saviour and the byzantine banner as their flag. The people of Rome secede their land to our Emperor in order for the new capital to be rebuilt !! Great projects are undertaken, like the new palace and Ippodromos. Colloseum is rebuilt !! That much splendor was not to be seen even in the old Rome !!;x;;
