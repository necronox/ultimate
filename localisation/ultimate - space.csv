EVTDESC170000;Technological advances have opened up a new frontier - Space. Scientists from all major nations are now putting into practice plans to send national assets into orbit in order for their country to be the first to reap the benefits from these technologies. The most ambitious plan being a manned mission to the moon and back, which would strenghten our place in the world as well as providing valuable scientific data for our researchers.;x

EVTNAME170004;First Moon Colony Founded;x
EVTDESC170004;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ organisations have announced today that they have successfully permanently settled the first men on the Moon. The Moon, with its significantly lower gravity, lack of atmosphere and unique geological features, could prove invaluable to our scientists, and its dusty soil is said to hide many rare resources. Although time only will tell whether the enterprise was worth it, the so-called 'space colonists' involved are said to be excited and determined to make it so, this is undoubtedly an historic moment!;x
